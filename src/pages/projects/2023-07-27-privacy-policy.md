This document details the privacy practices of [www.knifely.com](http://www.knifely.com/).

**DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU** We might collect your name, email, mailing address, phone numbers, or payment details. In mobile platforms, your location may also be captured.

**HOW WE UTILIZE YOUR DATA**

* **Attending to Your Needs:** We may use your data to address your questions or to enroll you in promotions.
* **Enhancing Our Services:** Your data aids us in tailoring your experience and refining our offerings.
* **Analyzing Trends:** Your data assists us in identifying trends, making improvements, and aligning our services with user preferences. Sometimes, we combine your information with data from third parties for this purpose.
* **Security Measures:** We use data to secure our business, our users, and our platform.
* **Staying Connected:** We might communicate about changes in our policies, website terms, or issues with any transactions.

**SHARING YOUR DATA** Your data might be disclosed in the following scenarios, in line with legal permissions:

* Within our business or associated entities.
* With partners assisting us in our services. This includes vendors, some of which might be based outside the U.S.
* For legal obligations, in instances like responding to legal orders, or when requested by government or investigative authorities. We might also share data to safeguard our users or websites, or to collaborate in fraud prevention.
* During business transitions, such as acquisitions or sales.

**DURATION OF DATA STORAGE** Comments, along with their metadata, are stored indefinitely for ease in recognizing and approving subsequent comments.

Registered users have their data stored in their profiles. They can view and edit this data (except username changes). Site administrators also have access.

**YOUR DATA CONTROL RIGHTS** Registered users or commenters can request an exported file of the personal data we possess. Erasure of personal data can also be requested, barring data retained for administrative, legal, or security needs.

**DATA TRANSFER** Comments might undergo automated spam detection processes.

**COMMENTING** When commenting, the data in the comment form, the IP address, and browser data are collected for spam detection. If you're using Gravatar, an anonymized string from your email might be used. Upon comment approval, your profile picture is publicly shown.

**CONTACT FORMS AND COOKIES** If you comment, you can choose to save your name, email, and website in cookies for convenience, lasting a year.

On logging in, we set a short-term cookie to check browser cookie support, which is discarded on closing the browser. On logging in, other cookies are set to remember your login and display preferences.

**CONTENT EMBEDDED FROM EXTERNAL SITES** Embedded content (e.g., videos or images) from other sites behaves like direct visits to those sites. These sites may track your interactions if you're logged into them.

**EXTERNAL LINKS** Links might lead to third-party platforms not under our purview. This policy doesn't extend to such platforms.

**SAFEGUARDING YOUR DATA** While we strive to protect your information, the Internet isn't entirely secure. Exercise caution when sharing information.

**POLICY UPDATES** We periodically amend our policies. You'll be notified of significant changes as per legal mandates. Regularly review our site for updates.
