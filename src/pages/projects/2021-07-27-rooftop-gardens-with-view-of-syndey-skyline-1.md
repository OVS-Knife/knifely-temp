Your kitchen knives are an important investment, whether you’re a professional chef or an amateur at-home cook. Chopping vegetables, portion-sizing meat, and cutting up fruit is not only much easier with the help of knife sharpening services but also much safer, as working with a dull knife forces you to add more force and can result in serious cuts. Knifely’s mail-in knife sharpening services are available to home chefs, working culinary professionals, and interested foodies who are ready to upgrade their everyday cooking experiences! Discover our full knife sharpening process below to see how we can help keep your hands safe!

## **PLACE YOUR ORDER**

If your professional working knives or everyday kitchen knives are not cutting as well as they used to, chances are they’re just a little dull and need to be sharpened. Knifely’s mail-in knife sharpening services allow you to take care of this issue in an affordable manner, instead of going through the trouble of purchasing a whole new set. The first step to getting your knives professionally sharpened to the quality a restaurant chef would use is to place your order right on our website. From there, you will receive a prepaid shipping box in the mail.
