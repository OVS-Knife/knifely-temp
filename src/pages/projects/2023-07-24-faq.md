## Should I get my dull store brand kitchen knives sharpened?

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>
Yes! Even your store or no named brand knives deserve a good sharpening. Just because these knives were more cost-effective than purchasing more expensive knives they are still typically made with quality steel.

## How long will my sharpened knives last?

<details>
<summary>View Answer</summary>
It is recommended that you have your kitchen knives sharpened every six months if not more depending on usage. To get your knives in tip-top shape we recommend honing knives before use, always handwashing and drying your knives, and placing them directly into your knife block.
